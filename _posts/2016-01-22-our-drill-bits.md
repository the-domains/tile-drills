**Tile Drill Bit.co.uk--The Proper Way to do it!**

Are you looking for some of the ways on how to drill on your tiled wall? Below is the simple approach to secure the tiles that you start on drilling.

* Select Drill Bit. You have to understand that the regular drill bit was not strong enough. You will also have a hard time drilling through the hard tile surface. There are 2 common drill bits recommended for such task.

You can make use of carbide tipped masonry drill bits as the most widely used and known for tile drill. These are designed to get through the rock hard surfaces. These can be used even without causing the tile to crack or break.

The other one is known as the diamond tipped drill bit. This is durable and is recommended by a lot of professional individuals for a boring hard tile surface. This can be very expensive (Not TileDrill.com) but you may still want to spend your money on it.

* Breaking Ground. The hardest part of tile drilling without ruining it is on getting through the glazed hardened outer surface. Remember that tiles are known to be "strong". They can also withstand the different types of abuses.

They are known for their durability and for being drilling resistant. The bit can skip around the surface than bite to the tile. But, there are some tricks of trade you can employ to do this effectively.

You can start by making an X mark on the tile since this will serve as your guide in drilling. Use masking tape for this process is essential. Make sure that your measure it again after placing the masking tape. This is to make it sure that it is not misplaced. And then, start drilling into the masking tape. Moreover, the masking tape provides your bit with an adequate "surface traction" for that accurate result.

* Boring Through: Once you start drilling, be patient in doing it until it breaks through. If your tile is hard, this will take several times. Thus, you need to start slowly using while gradually increasing the speed 800 -- 1000 RPM.

Bear in mind that tile drilling is not about the speed but the persistence. You need to apply a firm and constant pressure. This should not be in excess since this causes a tile breakage. You drill tip must be kept "lubricated" to avoid it from wearing down, breaking or overheating. The safest way of lubricating and cooling is by applying water. You can create a hose system for you to best deliver a constant water trickle on the bit; you can also spray it with water.

The Backside: Once you get through the tile, the pressure is off. To finish the project, you need to drill to push through the mounting surface or wall board. You need to decrease the pressure and speed. And then, simply switch it to a regular tile drill bit to end the hole
